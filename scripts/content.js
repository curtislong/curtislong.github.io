        <h4>Early-Stage Projects & Systems</h4>
        <p>I’m an early investor and early operator at ProGen.<br>I move between project management, systems design, operations, and creative tooling. I help small teams take the chaotic beginning of an idea and turn it into something that can actually ship.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="work-pillar">
        <h4>Story & Worldmaking</h4>
        <p>I’m writing <em>Love Letters from the Apocalypse</em>, a long-form speculative fiction project about human beings who keep moving even when the world is cracked around them. It blends narrative, worldbuilding, and a sense of cinematic ruin and wonder.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="work-pillar">
        <h4>Creative Technology</h4>
        <p>I like when technology feels a little haunted by the human hand. I work with generative imagery, prompt design, and AI-driven creative exploration as tools to help bring human ideas to life.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="work-pillar">
        <h4>Craft & Making</h4>
        <p>Outside of tech and writing, I’ve been refitting a 1970s yawl and doing the carpentry myself.<br>Undoing fifty seasons of weather and wear reminds me that what’s worth keeping is rarely pristine, only repaired.</p>
