        description: `"<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_River' target='_blank'>Moon River</a>" is an original composition for the screen, written by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer for Audrey Hepburn to sing in <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em>. Its significance is rooted in Mancini's childhood in the Southern United States. The opening stanza begins, "Moon River, wider than a mile. I'm crossing you in style, someday." I interpret the Moon River as both destiny and adventure. I like to think I'm adrift on the Moon River, letting the current take me to the next adventure. Here are some of my pictures from along the way.`
